# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

The healthcare industry collects an enormous amount of data every year which includes hospital records, medical records, and results of various medical examinations and tests of patients. For early diagnosis of a disease, the doctor analyses the reports solely based on his knowledge and experience and then predicts about the disease, but that can be inaccurate and vulnerable to errors. Hence, such decisions and predictions can be alarming and put the patient at risk. And therefore, if the prediction turns out to be inaccurate and wrong, the patient may either experience unnecessary stress or may not be able to receive the appropriate treatment on time. So an automated system with a higher accuracy, could prove to be advantageous for the early detection and prediction of diabetes.

So we have proposed a solution in order to solve this problem. In our proposed solution, we first use the data mining method in order to pre-process the collected healthcare input data and select the relevant features from it, and the several machine learning classification algorithms to train the model with the integrated input data set and their accuracies are compared. Hence, a decision is made and we finally propose the most accurate algorithm that we will use to predict diabetes based on the early symptoms of patients from the input dataset.
